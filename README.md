# CNN for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

## Project Description
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and achieves high accuracy in recognizing digits from 0 to 9. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of deep learning, image preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset (normalization and reshaping)
- CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers
- Training with validation and early stopping
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix visualization
- Visualization of sample predictions and heatmap of confusion matrix

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
